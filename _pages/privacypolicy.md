# Privacy Policy
Your data privacy is important to us. We have done our best to outline how your data is collected, stored and deleted, as easily as possible. We encourage you to read the entire document. The Skates iOS app maybe referred to as ‘Skates'’, ‘iOS app’ or ‘app’ within this document.

#### The Shortened version:
We do **NOT** collect any data from you. No way to see what you're storing, no analytics of how you use the app. Your data is exactly that...yours.

<br>

## 1.0 Data Collection
What data is being collected by this app, and how it may present whilst using it.

### 1.1 Personal Information – Data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.
Nothing. It's not possible. Anything that you store in the app is kept either locally or within your iCloud account. It is not accessible to us. If you would like any more information on how Apple stores your data, you can visit the [Apple Privacy website](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

### 1.2 Non Personal Information – data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.
The Skates app stores the Athletes, Programs, and any data associated with them, such as scores, within Core Data. This is a Framework provided by Apple, and is secured by your Apple ID. We do not have access to any of the data stored within your account. We do not log any keystrokes, search queries or how you use our app. In order to sync data across multiple devices, another Apple Framework is utilised (CloudKit). This is directly connected to your Apple ID, however, all data is encrypted and cannot be seen by Skates.

### 1.3 Analytics
This app uses no Third Party Analytics or metrics. The app does utilise Apple's Logging API, but this is stored on the device, and not sent to the developer. It is used when building the app in a development environment, and is not able to transmit logs remotely from other devices.

### 1.4 TestFlight and Debugging Data
If you are using a development version of the app, through the `TestFlight` app. You maybe asked if you would like to submit feedback. This can be in the form of sceenshots or crash reports. This is voluntary option, and is not required. All data is stored through Apple, and only the crash reason is delivered. None of your personal information, such as Personal Identification Numbers, are sent.

We use Apple's opt-in service for crash reporting. Your device model, iOS version, the timestamp of when the crash occurred and any other crash data that is automatically created by the Operating System, will be viewable. However, this is an **opt-in**, and can be disabled at any time.

<br>

## 2.0 Third Party Libraries
The app does use some Third Party Libraries. However, none of these libraries are used to log any of your data. For transparency a list of the libraries can be found below, and within the About section of the app.

| Library | What is it used for? |
| :--- | :--- |
| CloudStorage | A wrapper around the `NSUbiqitousKeyValueStore`. Used to track settings across devices  |
| MarkdownUI | Used to render Markdown text within the app. |
| OctoKit | Used to Feedback Submission |
| StyledText | Used to show highlighted matching characters in the search results. |

## 3.0 Updates to this Policy
We may change/amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or we may make changes to our business. We will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review our Privacy Policy to stay informed.

Should we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, we will provide additional notice of those changes. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should remove the app.
